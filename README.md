# Flappy Brain
Using Java, a neural network and a genetic algorithm, I created a simulation of the game Flappy Bird with a player that learns
the game and eventually becomes a master of.

## Requirements
You need to have the latest Java version installed on your computer

## Getting started
You'll need to run the Main.java class to get started.I would also recommend playing with the parameters of the genetic algorithm under the GA.java class and the networks shape under the NeuralNetwork.java class.
